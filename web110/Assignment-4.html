    <p>View email message headers.
Review Wikipedia: Email spoofing.
Review Google: Message headers or Livewire: How to View the Source of a Message in Mozilla Thunderbird to learn how to view email headers in your webmail service or email client.
Follow the instructions to view message headers for a message you received. Verify that the message was sent by the displayed From: address rather than being spoofed.
Emails spoofing involves the creation of a forged email address from the sender. Any reply sent to this address would not be received or would be sent to an unrelated third party. This method is often used for scams with serious financial consequences. I used the google header analyzer to scan an email from Harper. Their system is easy to use to check for any spoof senders or a fake account. This system would be helpful to prevent hacking or malware on your computer system.
