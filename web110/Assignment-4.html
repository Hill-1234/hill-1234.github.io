    <p>View email message headers.
Review Wikipedia: Email spoofing.
Review Google: Message headers or Livewire: How to View the Source of a Message in Mozilla Thunderbird to learn how to view email headers in your webmail service or email client.
Follow the instructions to view message headers for a message you received. Verify that the message was sent by the displayed From: address rather than being spoofed.
Emails spoofing involves the creation of a forged email address from the sender. Any reply sent to this address would not be received or would be sent to an unrelated third party. This method is often used for scams with serious financial consequences. I used the google header analyzer to scan an email from Harper. Their system is easy to use to check for any spoof senders or a fake account. This system would be helpful to prevent hacking or malware on your computer system. Through this activity I have learned how to use an applicaiton to check for amail spoofing and hwo that applies to keeping your email and information secured. This informstion has many applications ushc as for personal emails as well as work emails or for a larger company to ensure safe email precatices with their employees.

<p> Use Internet mailing lists.
Research popular Internet mailing lists. Consider signing up for any that interest you.
Research bulk email restrictions and identify appropriate ways to send bulk email messages.
When searching for email mailing lists restrictions a list came up of rules to follow when starting a mailing list. First is to get the consent of your recipients, a cursory email with a subscribe or opt in option allows users to choose if they want to receive emails about your service. Another rule for bulk mailing lists is that you must follow spam laws depending on your region. Oftentimes this results in a header or footer identifying the sender of the email. An additional rule about mailing lists is to avoid deceptive content. This includes fake headers, footers, subject lines, and sending addresses. Other regulations include that the content in the emails should compose a clear message for the recipient. As well as including an option to unsubscribe from the list or a schedule for when messages are sent. These are the best practices when it comes to creating a bulk mail list and this can be applied for a work scenario or personal use like sharing a blog post or personal info. Through this activity I learned the etiquitte for mailing lists and how they help people create appealing subsciption lists.
