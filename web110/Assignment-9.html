<p style="color:red;">My personal learning experience for this session was that the code is useful for assigning color and margins to arrange and personalize a website. While I would consider this type of coding harder than what we have done in the past, I see it has many uses in the creation of websites. 
While attempting to complete these activities I learned the different methods of changing the settings on the website and how they function to edit the site. The implementation of the style sheet was confusing at first and how to have it function across the index pages.
