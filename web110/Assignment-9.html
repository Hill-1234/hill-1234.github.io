  <h1 style="color:blue;">CSS Summary</h1>

<p style="color:red;">I found the use of CSS more difficult than HTML coding. I understand the use is for styleizing the webpage but the different styles are not very necessary in my mind. I can see this being useful for making a personal website in the future such as a blog or marketplace. In general this would be used in the workplace to add a personal touch to a created website and have your design choices shine through the code.  </p>

    <style>
      body {background-color: cyan;}
      h1 {color: red;} Internal
      p {color: blue;} Internal style is for editing an html page as opposed to a single element 
    </style>
  </body>
</html>
