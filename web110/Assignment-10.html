    <p>I found the use of the different tags for adding images, audio and video to a website very simple and straightforward. The only step I found to be difficult was making sure my audio was in my github folder and then linking it in the assignment 10 HTML page. I would use this information to add images and audio files to my future website projects. On a site it is helpful to have text as well as video explanations for discussing a topic. </p>
