    <p><b>Activity-1:Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?</b> Accessibility is important when creating a website because you want everyone to have equal access to your site. This doesn't just mean those who are disabled but also people who are on mobile devices or have slow internet connection. They define accessibility as giving everyone the same opportunity no matter their differences. Designing around these differences could include color visuals that are readable to people who are colorblind. Installing a screen reader to your site so those who are visually impaired can listen to your site. This is useful to know for the future so if I am employed for web design or creating my own site for my own business I can put these accessibility features into place so make the site friendly to all. </p>
    <p><b>Activity-2:Use the Paletton website to identify good color schemes. Experiment with monochromatic, adjacent-color, three-color, and four-color designs.</b> For the paletton site it was interesting moving the color selector around and changing the saturation and shade of the colors. The picker also made it easy to find complementary and analogous color schemes. i found that having a 2 warm colors and a cool toned color gave the combination good contrast. This site would be good for finding a color scheme for your site and making sure the colors have good contrast. I could see this being useful in my future for selecting limited color pallets in marketing projects or for selecting colors on my own site.</p>
