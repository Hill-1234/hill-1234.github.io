    <p>For assignment 8 I thought the coding for the list was simple to follow. The site where there is a sample list to copy is helpful and then it makes the list of assignments a lot easier to create. Knowing the tags and how to begin and end the lines is important knowledge and is explained well in the presentation. This information could be useful for me for making my own site for a business to sell my art.
