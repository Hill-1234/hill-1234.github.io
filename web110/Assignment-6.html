    <p>Research, identify and describe the necessary components required to set-up a home network for yourself.
To begin setting up a home network on your own you need to consider the hardware youâ€™ll need depending on your internet connection. The typical house needs an access device, typically a cable or asymmetric DSL modem, a router for directing traffic into and out of your network, a switch for connecting wired clients and an access point (AP) for connecting wireless clients. Then you need to consider the type of devices you use and how they should be wired or if they are wired at all. For a simple system the router is wired right into a tv or computer. A switch would control what areas get better connection due to the ethernet power being diverted.

  <p> Review Apple: Mac Basics: File Sharing. Share a folder on your system.
Review Apple: Connect to Shared Computers and File Servers on a Network. From another computer, connect to the shared folder.
The system for sharing a folder in apple is very simple to use. The easy to find share option  makes it quick to share a file and send it to a separate device. This means that you can get feedback on a project quickly or send a file to a client for approval. The computer sharing program is also a quick and simple way to share a file. The connection can be between several systems thus making it easier to see a file on multiple screens. I can see this being applied for a workspace that needs to share files quickly for collaboration. In my personal life I see this as valuable in a future work environment as it allows files to be shared and set quicker than with email since the computers are connected as if they are on the same network.
