    <p>Research, identify and describe the necessary components required to set-up a home network for yourself.
To begin setting up a home network on your own you need to consider the hardware youâ€™ll need depending on your internet connection. The typical house needs an access device, typically a cable or asymmetric DSL modem, a router for directing traffic into and out of your network, a switch for connecting wired clients and an access point (AP) for connecting wireless clients. Then you need to consider the type of devices you use and how they should be wired or if they are wired at all. For a simple system the router is wired right into a tv or computer. A switch would control what areas get better connection due to the ethernet power being diverted.
