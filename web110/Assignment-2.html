Activity 1: Chrome is the browser made by google with their search engine built into the main page layout. It is very user friendly as the tab layout is simple as well as the option for multiple accounts to keep everything organized. The multi account function allows for access to all the information from one browser. The chrome help center has tutorials for every function of the browser and information about the different options available with chrome. The opening tab page has access to the google drive and other google products all from one quicklinks menu. As far as the security of the site it allows you to change what they have access to and how they track your data. It also uses security indicators and malware protection, these are constantly running when using the browser to protect people browsing the internet. For more security when searching they have several ways of controlling your privacy, you can modify your privacy settings, delete browsing history and search in incognito mode. This information is useful for the future when deciding what browser to use depending on what you value for your search. If you prioritize easy searching and high security while you are browsing, then the choice is google chrome. Another way this information is useful is when you need access to other sites through this browser. For instance if you needed Microsoft Word for a written document then you would not use google chrome since they allow access to google products and not microsoft products.
Activity 2: Edge is a browser made by Microsoft that has a simple tab layout with lots of personalization features. In the main tab page there is the option for split tab pages that allows two tabs to be open in one page. As well as the different options for saving a webpage, they have bookmarks as well as “collections” they claim this saves any page or image right where you left it. As far as security is concerned for this browser they have malware detectors and security indicators that appear in the address bar when using a site. They have a warning before entering sites that have malware detected. This allows the user to keep their information safe by being aware of the dangers of a site before they use it. Edge also has private browsing and the ability to delete your browsing history. What I learned about his browser that will be useful in the future is that it has the capabilities to use multiple tabs in one page so you can be searching two different topics in one area. Edge also has good security and privacy measures to ensure safe browsing.
