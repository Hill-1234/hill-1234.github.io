<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>I found the use of CSS more difficult than HTML coding. I understand the use is for styleizing the webpage but the different styles are not very necessary in my mind. I can see this being useful for making a personal website in the future such as a blog or marketplace. In general this would be used in the workplace to add a personal touch to a created website and have your design choices shine through the code. </p>
