<p><b>Final Project Summary:</b>For the final project I will be focusing on graphics and multimedia. I chose this topic because I find it interesting learning how to add images and video elements to a site. Learning to code the images into the site allowed me to personalize my github and add visual elements in the future. I will present information about adding visuals and how they interact with your site. As a graphic design major I find a combination of text and visual important. I will also cover the concept of a lossless compression and how this affects your files. As well as the types of files and how they are used differently, such as GIF,JPEG,PNG, and TIFF</p>

<p><b>Assignment 15 Summary:</b>For this assignment with learning project management it was interesting learning the excel sheet formatting. That will be useful in the future to create a table of steps to complete a task. I could personally use it for a group design project where each member of the group has different deadlines to get the job done. Overall the concept of project management is useful for organizing information and can be used with other topics from this class. Like the organization of information from database research. </p>
