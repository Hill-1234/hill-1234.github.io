<p>For the final project I will be focusing on graphics and multimedia. I chose this topic because I find it interesting learning how to add images and video elements to a site. Learning to code the images into the site allowed me to personalize my github and add visual elements in the future. I will present information about adding visuals and how they interact with your site. As a graphic design major I find a combination of text and visual important. I will also cover the concept of a lossless compression and how this affects your files. As well as the types of files and how they are used differently, such as GIF,JPEG,PNG, and TIFF</p>
