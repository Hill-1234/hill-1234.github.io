    <p>To summarize what I learned in this section I would say it was interesting to learn how data is organized across multiple places. This information can be paired together to find information like who packed and shipped an order or what employees worked on that day when the order was shipped. I see this being useful for me for future workplaces and managing shipping orders out in a timely fashion. As well as managing an office and who works when. There needs to be a lot of organizing in the graphic design workflow and a database provides that organization. </p>
