    <p><b>Activity 3-</b>The resume builder was helpful for prioritizing the information to put onto a resume and how to catch the attention of the hiring managers. When working on making a resume I had to consolidate the information to create just a one page version. I looked into the resume helper at Harper and used their template when writing mine. I also made a linkedin profile where I am connected with Harper and several of my coworkers. This was helpful for getting a job in the future because linkedin is helpful for connecting with employers and business with internships. Linkedin also makes it easy to update your resume because they have a resume builder. I can see the resume builder being important when creating a new resume after getting more job experience. </p>
