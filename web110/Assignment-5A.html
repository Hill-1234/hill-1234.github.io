    <p>Review GCFLearnFree: Pinterest. If you don't already have a Pinterest account, sign up for Pinterest and create a board.
 Pinterest is the social media mostly used for crafts and art ideas. The easily accessible database is full of people posting and saving content similar to a digital scrapbook. A post on the app can also be bookmarks that bring you to a site for more information or the ability to purchase a product. I would say this site is helpful for those that like to organize the content they observe. The board saving method of pinning to your account allows for easy access at a later date. The site also allows you to follow accounts that you like and then their content appears on your page.

    <p>Complete the tutorial TutorialsPoint: Social Networking. Based on the information provided, decide which of the following social media sites interest you.
I can use the information from this tutorial to my environment by learning the types of social media and how they can be applied. For example the use of Facebook to instagram to share images or videos of my art work for others to see. The use of linkedin is helpful for finding a career and categorizing previous jobs you have had. The tutorial also explains scams and security threats which are helpful for the future and working in an online environment. It is helpful to know what to look out for when communicating through social media and the tutorial even guides you through how to encrypt your work for the future.
