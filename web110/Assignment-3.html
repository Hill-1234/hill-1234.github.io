    <p>Compare search engines.
Search for web search engine using Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. Compare the results from each search engine. Which search engine has the best user interface? Which search engine provides the most useful results?
Using your preferred search engine, search for search engine market share. Which search engine has the highest market share?
      The assignment task was to use a search engine to find out the market shares for the different search engines. I used google to search for this and found a site called “stat counter: global stats”. It stated that Google is the highest ranked search engine for market shares, it holds 91.61% of the total market share. The second place search engine is Bing with 3.38%. Third place is YANDEX with 1.65%. From this I learned that Google has the largest share in the search engine market. This means they control a large majority of people's searches and how people find content on the internet. This activity was simple while also being informative, knowing what search engine is the majority is useful for the future, such as when making my own website I would make sure it is able to be found on google and easily accessed. If a site cannot be found on google it is very likely to not be found at all since the other search engines are not used as often. </p>
    <p>Search for web search engines using Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. Compare the results from each search engine. Which search engine has the best user interface? Which search engine provides the most useful results?
In this activity the search results varied across the different sites. When searched on google the first result was directing traffic away from the search engine with an article titled “21 great search engines to use instead of google. The next results were similar in that they are attempting to take away users from Google. This may be due to the high market shares that google has and the fact that they are the most used search engine. Bing and Yahoo had the same top 3 results for the search then they listed their own browser as the next link option. This led me to believe both sites use similar crawlers or indexes as they had the same results. As well as informing me that both sites are attempting to direct traffic to their own sites and away from google or other search engines, even when the user is already using that site to search. On a different note when a web search engine is entered into Ask the first result was Google. Followed by additional search engines, this tells me that Ask’s indexes or crawlers search for the most used or searched for results. These are different results than the other search engines likely due to how little Ask is used as a search engine. This information is helpful for the future by providing information on what search engine a user is sent to for searching. Then you should focus on that site to advertise your own site or services. </p>
<p>Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
Add a web page to a search engine. Review Google: Get your content on Google. Practice by adding this Wikiversity page URL to Google Search
The assigned task was to add the Wikiversity site to google. The information provided to add a site to google is slightly outdated as the search engine has since increased security to dissuade malware sights or hacking scams. In addition when a site has the option to be added it may take several weeks to be loaded into the search engine due to the amount of requests they get to add a site to their index. There is the opportunity to index your site and check if google has your site already in their system. In addition when trying to add your site to google they have you verify ownership of the site. This is checked immediately to add a layer of security for your site. That way Google knows that your site is an actual website that can be found in their system. This dissuades fake sites or malware being added to Google’s indexes.</p>
