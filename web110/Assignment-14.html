    <p><B>Summary Paragraph-</B> From this activity I learned the use of SQL commands in databases and how to add them into a website. The W3 site made it easy to differentiate the code in the different commands. I found it interesting how the different instructions can be used in your site to control the results from the database. I can see this being useful in the future to organize results from  a survey or organizing information form a larger data group. The SQL instructions add a factor of being able to find a common factor in the data bases.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>SELECT Customername FROM Customers;</li>
  <li>WHERE Country='USA';</li>
  <li>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;</li>
  <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</li>
  <li>UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;</li>
