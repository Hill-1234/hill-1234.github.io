Intro- The concept of graphics and multimedia in web design is applied throughout web design. Adding images, video or audio to a website allows users to visualize a concept. 

MP#1-Graphics-  Computer graphics is the use of computers to generate images and art. This technology is used in video games, film, photography, digital art, and computer displays. The term was created in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. When this technology is used in film it is typically referred to as CGI or computer generated imagery. 
Vector VS Raster- vector graphics are created using mathematical formulas. This allows perfect lines and scalability without losing any quality. A raster image is a two dimensional image created with pixels. This means the image is not scalable as it will be a different quality when the size is changed. 

MP#2- How it relates to web design- Graphics play an important role in web design and development. They can add visual interest and improve the appearance of a website. Graphics can be used to convey information or the brand message to website users. When a brand design is effective it adds a sense of credibility to the company and an organization to the information of the site. In addition, positive graphics encourage a user to stay on the site and engage with the content. The design and layout of a site can affect the marketing of the brand and how many customers they get. 

MP#3- Applied examples- As a graphic design student I was tasked with designing the layout of a website homepage and the images and copy text to accompany it. This design was chosen by the client and they use it as their website layout. The images, use of color and links to lead you to new information made this website a great start to their campaign. <p/>
